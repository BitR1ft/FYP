Pytest configuration

Week 3 note: auth.py and projects.py now delegate to AuthService /
ProjectService via Prisma.  The in-memory `users_db` and `projects_db` stubs
still exist for backward-compat, but are not used by the live endpoints.
Integration tests override the FastAPI dependencies to inject mock services.

    modules that were written against the old API may still reference them.
